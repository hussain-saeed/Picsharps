1 go to "adminAuthSlice" and check for the role id, then give it a name
2 go to "AdminRoutes" and for each route we can decide which roles will be allowed exactly in the array
3 go to "AdminMainLayout" and add the navlink refering to the path
4 we can use the same approach found in "AdminMainLayout" to apply the same concept in other places
